# Markerless Pose and Behavior Prediction for Rat Models

Here we have provided an open source software pipeline to estimate animal pose and detect a limited set of animal behaviors that are important for biomedical animal studies which include locomotion analysis, prevelence of Rearing, and prevelence of stereotopic behavior.
